NFCGate is an Android application meant to capture, analyze, or modify NFC traffic. It can be used as a researching tool to reverse engineer protocols or assess the security of protocols against traffic modifications.

<ul>
<li><strong>On-device capture</strong>: Captures NFC traffic sent and received by other applications running on the
device.</li>
<li><strong>Relay</strong>: Relays NFC traffic between two devices
using <a href="https://github.com/nfcgate/server">a server</a>. One device operates as a "reader" reading an
NFC tag, the other device emulates an NFC tag using the Host Card Emulation (HCE).</li>
<li><strong>Replay</strong>: Replays previously captured NFC traffic in either "reader" or "tag" mode.</li>
<li><strong>Clone</strong>: Clones the initial tag information (e.g. ID).</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/pcapng/pcapng">pcapng</a> export of captured NFC traffic, readable by Wireshark.</li>
</ul>
